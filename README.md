## Gameplay Modes

### 1. Waste Segregation
Players sort trash into the correct bins within a limited time(microplastics, macroplastics & megaplastics) in a mini-game designed to highlight the importance of proper waste management.

### 2. Animal Exploration & Almanac
Explore different environments to find and collect endangered animals. Each discovery unlocks facts about their habitat, threats, and conservation status in the in-game almanac.

### 3. Fight Against Poachers *(Prototype)*
A prototype combat feature where players confront illegal loggers and poachers. This mode is still in early development—currently, enemies disappear upon contact and lack animation.
